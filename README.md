 
Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Ever met a daytime Supply Chain specialist and late-night Data Analyst?
Well, that's me! I have always been fascinated by data and visualization for as long as forever. From my first job as Data Entry to my current position as Advisor, I find analyzing data to be second nature to me. So I decided to **do something** professional about it this year. I learned to code in **R and SQL** yaay! ðŸ˜„.

As you can guess, I am super stoked and looking forward to participating in my first competition. 

âš¡ Outside of work, I love arranging spaces ðŸŒ± & teaching Maths to kids. Coffee is a no-no, blame it on my heart's rhythms & beatz.

Want to know more about me ðŸ“«, connect with me via
