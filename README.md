Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Have you ever met a daytime Supply Chain specialist and late-night **Data Analyst?

Well, that's me! I have always been fascinated by data and visualization for as long as forever. From my first job as Data Entry Operator, to my current position as Advisor, I find analyzing data to be second nature to me. Having used Spreadsheets for a couple of years, I decided to brush up by learning to manipulate and visualize data using **R, SQL, Tableau & Power BI. Yaay for me**!ðŸ˜„.

Covid changed the world and so did I by upskilling. Did I mention that I applied myself to learning **Anaplan** (*a cloud-based business-planning software that provides data for decision-making)? 2021 was a year of all things DATA. I am an **Anaplan certified Model Builder (Level 2)** Woot woot!.
