 
Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Have you ever met a daytime Supply Chain specialist and late-night Data Analyst?

Well, that's me! I have always been fascinated by data and visualization for as long as forever. From my first job as Data Entry Operator to my current position as Advisor, I find analyzing data to be second nature to me. Having used Excel for quite sometime, i decided to move on up to R, SQL & Python this year. Yaay for me!ðŸ˜„.

As you can guess, I am super stoked and looking forward to taking on a full time Analytics role.

Did i mention that I applied myself to learning Anaplan (a cloud-based business-planning software that provides data for decision-making)? 2021 was indeed a year of all things DATA. I am a certified Model Builder (Level 2) Woot woot!!

âš¡ Outside of work, you can tell I love reading, I also love arranging spaces ðŸŒ±. You can be sure not to meet my couch in the same place it was during your first visit. 

Want to know more about me ðŸ“«, connect with me via
